//Q. Write a Java Program to print message using class

                                                        then 2nd <return type> (The data type of the value returened by the method  or we can use void if it does not return a value and it is mandatory in syntax) 
                                                             then 3rd is <method_name> (we can write our own) 
                                                                then 4th (List_of_parameters) (Comma-separated list of the input parameters is defined, preceded by their data type, within the enclosed parenthesis. 
                                                                If there are no parameters but you must use empty parentheses ().
